# 🌟 **6-Month Roadmap to Level Up Your English**

I’m breaking it into **phases** so you always know what to do next.

---

# **📅 Phase 1 — Foundation Building (Month 1–2)**

Focus only on essential grammar:

* Tenses (Present, Past, Future)
* Modals (can, could, should, must)
* Active & Passive
* Conditionals (0, 1, 2)

**Daily Task:**
Watch *one* short YouTube lesson daily:
Search: **"English with Lucy tenses"**, **"Learn English Grammar basic"**.

**Practice:**
Write 5 sentences about your daily routine every day.

---

### **2) Vocabulary (20 min/day)**

Learn **10 new words/day** from these categories:

* Daily life
* Tech / Web development (important for your career)
* Emotions
* Actions

**How to learn:**

* Search each word’s meaning + example sentence

### **3) Speaking Practice (15–20 min/day)**

You can practice with:
